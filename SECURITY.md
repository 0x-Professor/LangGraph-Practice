# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depend on the version number:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Security Vulnerability Disclosure

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our open-source software. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report vulnerabilities by emailing [SECURITY_EMAIL] with the subject line containing "[SECURITY]" followed by a brief description of the issue.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Updates, Alerts and Notifications

- Security updates will be released as minor or patch version updates
- Security advisories will be published as GitHub Security Advisories
- Critical security vulnerabilities will be announced through the repository's security advisory feature

## Security Considerations for Developers

### Dependencies

- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Use `pip-audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Review and update `requirements.txt` regularly

### Secure Coding Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Sanitize all inputs to prevent XSS and other injection attacks

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper authentication mechanisms
   - Use strong password policies
   - Implement proper session management
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords) to version control

4. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log errors securely

5. **Dependency Security**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Remove unused dependencies
   - Use dependency checking tools

## Security Tools

We recommend using the following tools to identify security issues:

- `bandit` - Security linter for Python code
- `safety` - Checks Python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
- `pip-audit` - Audits Python environments for packages with known vulnerabilities
- `truffleHog` - Finds secrets accidentally committed to git repositories

## Security Training

All contributors are encouraged to complete the following free security training:

- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/)
- [SANS Cyber Aces Online](https://tutorials.cyberaces.org/)

## Security Updates

This security policy may be updated from time to time. The version history can be viewed by checking the repository's commit history.
